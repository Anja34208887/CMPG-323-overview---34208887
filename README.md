# CMPG-323-overview---34208887

## Project Overview

The module consists of 5 individual projects all addressing a specific coding challenge and environment. Each project will be encapsulated within its own repository, meaning that a repository will be created for each project and all of its files and components will be stored there. The five repositories are listed below and will link you to the relevent repository on my Github workspace.

1. [CMPG-323-Overview](https://github.com/Anja34208887/CMPG-323-overview---34208887.git)
2. [CMPG-323-API](https://github.com/Anja34208887/CMPG-323-API---34208887)
3. [CMPG-323-Standards and patterns](https://github.com/Anja34208887/CMPG-323-Standards-and_Patterns---34208887)
4. [CMPG-323-Testing and RPA](https://github.com/Anja34208887/CMPG-323-Project-4-34208887-)
5. [Repository_5]()

**NOTE:** The repositories will be created later (when work is initiated on the corresponding project) as this will influence the .gitignore file, the project description and even the project name.

Each of the projects and their repositories will contribute to the CMPG 323 module. This means that the prerequisites for passing the module is identified as passing each project individually. This is shown below.

## Project Description

The purpose of the CMPG 323 module is to enhance programming skills across various platforms and establishing fundamental principles for various concepts that will be valuable for building a career in an Information Technology field. Planning is essential as it is important to manage and sufficiently complete tasks before the deadlines are up. The scope of work for the entire semester is also established and the some important skill areas are identified:

* Agile (scrum)
* Source control
* Cloud based technology
* Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
* Design and architecture patterns
* Testing
* Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
* Data visualising and reporting

Although there are additional programming skills and concepts required to successfully complete the projects, these skills are crucial for passing the module and will be focused on the most..


## Branching Strategy

Branching will be used to isolate each individual feature or in some cases, a section of code that will be edited and tested on its own before being merged onto the master branch consisting of the overarching project. This allows the individual components to be error-tested and troubleshooted before being combined with other code sections (since erronous code can affect the entire project). The branching is not limited to one or even two different feature branches but rather to each identifiable component that can be reduced to easily digestable coding sections. This means that the number of branches is not set and that additional,  sub-branches can be added if it remains within the context of a specific coding problem that is addressed by the feature. A branch can be created for fixing coding errors or improving on specific code which had previously been completed.

The diagram below is a representation of the branching strategies that will be used for each project and how it interacts with the master branch.

## Gitignore Functionality

The *.gitignore* file is created along with the project repository and can be defined to ignore certain file types within the repository. This means that the files or folders added to the gitignore file will not be tracked for changes or updates and this will not be mirrored or uploaded to the master repository. The file is very useful in keeping specific coding files constant such as header files which are extremely important in certain coding applications.

## Credentials and Sensitive Information

The gitignore file that was mentioned previously will typically be incorporated to ignore login files. This is due to the information of personal servers and profiles being confidential as one would not want anyone viewing the public repository access to the database itself. This is especially useful when working with cloud-based servers and databases containing potentially sensitive information. The file will be used to ensure privacy and security for each project.
